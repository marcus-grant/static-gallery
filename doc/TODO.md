- âœ… **JSON metadata system** - Complete with type-safe dataclasses and file hash calculation  
- âœ… **Dual-hash metadata system** - PhotoMetadata now has both `file_hash` and `deployment_file_hash` fields
- âœ… **Timezone settings** - Added `TARGET_TIMEZONE_OFFSET_HOURS = 13` (13 = preserve original timezone)
- âœ… **PhotoMetadataService** - Supports both filename parsing and JSON metadata reading
- âœ… **Template debug service** - Fixed to use generic render() method
- âœ… **Integration testing** - Full round-trip from photo processing to metadata consumption
- âœ… **Gallery-metadata.json generation** - Automatic during photo processing with corrected timestamps

- âœ… Comprehensive CORS test suite (`test/services/test_s3_storage.py::TestCORSConfiguration`)
- âœ… Enhanced deploy command tests with CORS validation (`test/command/test_deploy.py::TestDeployCommandCORSValidation`)

**Key files to understand:**
- `src/models/photo.py` - PhotoMetadata structure with dual hashes
- `src/services/s3_storage.py` - modify_exif_in_memory() function and CORS management
- `src/services/file_processing.py` - Lines 258-285: deployment hash calculation
- `src/services/deployment.py` - Deployment orchestration with metadata-last upload ordering
- `settings.py` - Line 58: TARGET_TIMEZONE_OFFSET_HOURS setting
- `doc/architecture/metadata-consistency.md` - Complete system documentation

**Phase 3 Complete - Dual Timezone System Implemented:**

**Dual Timezone System Explanation:**
- **`TIMESTAMP_OFFSET_HOURS`**: Corrects systematic camera time errors âœ… IMPLEMENTED
  - Example: Camera was set 2 hours fast â†’ offset = -2 to correct
- **`TARGET_TIMEZONE_OFFSET_HOURS`**: Sets actual timezone context for deployment âœ… IMPLEMENTED
  - Writes timezone info to EXIF `OffsetTimeOriginal` field per EXIF 2.31 standard
  - Format: `Â±HH:MM` (e.g., `-05:00` for EST, `+02:00` for CET)
  - Special value 13 = preserve original timezone (don't modify `OffsetTimeOriginal`)
- **Combined Logic**: corrected timestamp + timezone context = complete local time information âœ… IMPLEMENTED

âœ… **Completed Phase 3 Tasks:**
1. âœ… **`modify_exif_in_memory()` implemented in `src/services/s3_storage.py`**:
   - Function signature: `modify_exif_in_memory(image_bytes, corrected_timestamp, target_timezone_offset_hours) -> bytes`
   - Uses `piexif` library for in-memory EXIF modification
   - Applies corrected timestamp to `DateTimeOriginal`
   - Applies timezone offset to `OffsetTimeOriginal` in `Â±HH:MM` format (unless offset = 13)
   - Complies with EXIF 2.31 standard for timezone information
2. âœ… **Deployment hash calculation implemented in `src/services/file_processing.py:258-285`**:
   - Simulates EXIF modification during processing using both timezone settings
   - Calculates hash of modified image bytes (reflects both timestamp correction and timezone)
   - Stores as `deployment_file_hash` with error fallback
3. âœ… **Comprehensive test suite implemented**:
   - `test/services/test_s3_storage.py::TestExifModification` (8 tests)
   - `test/test_dual_hash_integration.py` (5 integration tests)
   - Full documentation in `doc/architecture/metadata-consistency.md`

## Current JSON Metadata System **[FOR NEW DEVELOPERS]**

**How it works**:
1. **Photo Processing** (`process_dual_photo_collection`):
   - Reads EXIF from original files
   - Applies `TIMESTAMP_OFFSET_HOURS` setting in memory
   - Calculates SHA256 hash of original source files
   - Generates chronological filenames using corrected timestamps
   - Creates `gallery-metadata.json` with type-safe dataclasses

2. **Metadata Structure** (see `src/models/photo.py`):
   - `GalleryMetadata` â†’ `PhotoMetadata` â†’ `MetadataExifData` + `MetadataFileData`
   - Stores both original and corrected timestamps
   - Includes file hashes for change detection
   - Camera info and file paths for all variants (full/web/thumb)

3. **PhotoMetadataService** (`src/services/photo_metadata.py`):
   - `generate_json_metadata()` - Legacy filename parsing (backward compatibility)
   - `generate_json_metadata_from_file()` - New JSON metadata reading
   - Converts metadata to frontend-optimized format

4. **Testing** (`test/services/test_photo_metadata.py`):
   - Integration test proves complete round-trip works
   - File hash calculation verified
   - JSON metadata generation tested

## Idempotent Deployment System **[COMPLETED âœ…]**

**Objective**: Enable selective deployment based on file changes using dual-hash metadata system with real-time EXIF modification.

**Key Innovation**: Calculate both original file hash and deployment file hash (after EXIF corrections) during photo processing, enabling accurate change detection for deployment.

**Status**: Complete implementation with Phases 1-5 all finished. Production-ready metadata-driven deployment system.

### Phase 1: Settings Enhancement âœ… **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Add timezone setting**: `TARGET_TIMEZONE_OFFSET_HOURS = 13` (13 = preserve original timezone)
- [x] **Environment variable support**: `GALLERIA_TARGET_TIMEZONE_OFFSET_HOURS`
- [x] **Test settings loading** and validation

### Phase 2: Dual Hash Metadata System âœ… **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Enhance PhotoMetadata dataclass** with `deployment_file_hash` field
- [x] **Update file_processing.py** to calculate both hashes:
  - `original_file_hash` (existing) - hash of source file
  - `deployment_file_hash` (placeholder) - will be hash after EXIF modifications applied
- [x] **Test metadata serialization** with both hashes

### Phase 3: EXIF Stream Processing âœ… **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Add `modify_exif_in_memory()`** to `s3_storage.py` for real-time EXIF modification
- [x] **EXIF modification streaming** - implemented in deployment workflow without temporary files
- [x] **Use piexif library**, preserve image quality, never store locally
- [x] **Test timezone application** and image integrity

### Phase 4: Deployment Orchestration âœ… **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Add metadata download/comparison** functions to `deployment.py`
- [x] **Add deployment plan generation** based on `deployment_file_hash` comparison
- [x] **Add S3 state verification** using `list_bucket_files()`
- [x] **Test complete workflow** with metadata-last upload ordering

âœ… **Completed Phase 4 Features:**
1. âœ… **`download_remote_metadata()`** - Downloads and parses remote metadata from S3 with error handling
2. âœ… **`generate_deployment_plan()`** - Compares local vs remote using `deployment_file_hash`, identifies changes
3. âœ… **`verify_s3_state()`** - Validates remote state matches expected metadata, detects inconsistencies  
4. âœ… **`deploy_gallery_metadata()`** - Complete workflow with metadata-last upload ordering for atomic consistency
5. âœ… **Comprehensive test suite** - 21 new tests covering all deployment scenarios
6. âœ… **Dry run support** - Preview deployment plans without executing
7. âœ… **Error handling** - Graceful failures with detailed error reporting

### Phase 4 Documentation Task
- [x] **Document deployment orchestration system** in appropriate doc hierarchy following contribution guidelines

### Phase 5: Deploy Command âœ… **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Enhanced `src/command/deploy.py`** with CLI arguments:
  - `--dry-run`: Show deployment plan without executing
  - `--force`: Ready for implementation (ignore hash comparison, upload everything)
  - `--progress`: Ready for implementation (show detailed progress during upload)
- [x] **Metadata-driven deployment** using Phase 4 orchestration system
- [x] **Integration tests** with complete TDD workflow
- [x] **Documentation** in `doc/command/deploy.md`

### Implementation Approach
- **TDD throughout** - test every function before implementation
- **Metadata-last uploads** - photos first, then metadata (atomic consistency)
- **Hash-based comparison** - only upload changed photos using `deployment_file_hash`
- **Settings-aware** - timezone changes trigger new deployment hashes during processing
- **Failure recovery** - partial uploads don't corrupt metadata, enable retry

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Dual hash system** - track both original and deployment file hashes
2. **Streaming EXIF modification** - never store corrected photos locally  
3. **Metadata-driven deployment** - compare deployment hashes, not file modification times
4. **Atomic operations** - metadata always reflects actual remote state
5. **Settings separation** - timestamp correction vs timezone are different concerns

## Real-world Deployment Testing **[NEXT PRIORITY]**

**Objective**: Set up and test production S3/Hetzner bucket with CDN integration.

**Prerequisites**: âœ… All deployment infrastructure complete (Phases 1-5). Ready for production testing.

## Project Overview

A static photo gallery built with a custom Python static site generator,
using AlpineJS for frontend interactions and
Tailwind CSS for styling.
Photos are processed with human-readable chronological filenames derived from EXIF data and
hosted on Hetzner object storage with BunnyCDN for global distribution.

### Conventions of Project

This is going for a django style settings, command and layout structure.
But we're also trying to find
a middle ground between django and FastAPI conventions.
In particular with functional paradigms,
like @click decorated commands for example.
Because this line between conventions is blurry, please ask.

### Priority

Speed of development and deployment over feature richness.
Get a working, acceptable user experience deployed quickly.

## Stack & Workflow Overview

### Technology Stack

- **Static Site Generator**: Custom Python generator with Jinja2 (Python 3.12)
- **Frontend**: AlpineJS + Tailwind CSS (CDN, no build step)
- **Photo Processing**: Python with Pillow, exifread
- **Storage**: Hetzner object storage (private + public buckets)
- **CDN**: BunnyCDN with Hetzner as origin
- **Development**: Local build -> Hetzner deployment
- **Package Management**: uv (Python package manager)
- **Testing**: pytest with `uv run pytest` command

### Photo Processing Workflow

```txt
Photographer's Photos -> EXIF Extraction -> Chronological Filename Generation ->
-> Thumbnail Creation -> Upload to Buckets ->
-> Custom HTML Generation -> Deploy
```

### Photo Organization Structure

```txt
Private Bucket (Hetzner):     Public Bucket (Hetzner):        Static Site:
/originals/                   /galleria-wedding/              Gallery page with:
  IMG_001.jpg                   {filename}.jpg  (full)         - Thumbnail grid
  IMG_002.jpg                   {filename}.jpg  (web)          - Infinite scroll
  ...                           {filename}.webp (thumb)        - Multi-select downloads
```

### Storage Strategy

- **Private Hetzner Bucket**: Original photos with authentication (personal archive)
- **Public Hetzner Bucket**: Full + web + thumbnail versions (for static site)
- **BunnyCDN**: Global CDN caching content from public Hetzner bucket

### Command Workflow & Sequence

The project follows a simplified workflow for processing and deploying the photo gallery:

```txt
Original Photos (PIC_SOURCE_PATH_FULL + PIC_SOURCE_PATH_WEB)
    â†“ [process-photos] 
Processed Photos (prod/pics)
    â†“ [build]
Static Site (OUTPUT_DIR)
    â†“ [deploy] 
Single S3 Bucket (photos + HTML + CSS + JS)
    â†“
Live Website
```

#### Command Overview

1. **`process-photos`** - Photo processing pipeline
   - Reads original photos from `PIC_SOURCE_PATH_FULL`
   - Reads web-optimized photos from `PIC_SOURCE_PATH_WEB` 
   - Extracts EXIF data and generates chronological filenames
   - Creates thumbnails (400x400 WebP) from web versions
   - Validates filename consistency between full and web collections
   - Outputs to `prod/pics` with structure:
     ```
     processed-photos/
       full/     (symlinks to originals with chronological names)
       web/      (symlinks to photographer's web-optimized versions)
       thumb/    (WebP thumbnails generated from web versions)
     ```

2. **`build`** - Static site generation  
   - Generates JSON metadata from processed photos
   - Creates static HTML using Jinja2 templates
   - Copies static assets (CSS/JS)
   - Outputs complete site to `OUTPUT_DIR`

3. **`deploy`** - Complete site deployment
   - Idempotently uploads entire site to single S3 bucket:
     - Photos (full/web/thumb) to `/photos/` prefix
     - Static site files (HTML/CSS/JS) to bucket root
     - JSON metadata for gallery functionality
   - Skips already uploaded files for efficiency
   - Supports dry-run and progress tracking
   - Handles CDN cache invalidation if needed

#### Usage Patterns

```bash
# Full pipeline for new gallery
python manage.py process-photos
python manage.py build  
python manage.py deploy --progress

# Development workflow
python manage.py process-photos --source ./test-photos
python manage.py build --dev-mode
python manage.py deploy --dry-run

# Quick site update (photos already processed)
python manage.py build
python manage.py deploy
```

**Note**: Commands are designed to be idempotent - running them multiple times is safe. The `deploy` command handles all upload operations to maintain consistency.

## Development Tasks & Specifications

### Static Site Generation **[COMPLETED]**

**Deliverable**: Static HTML gallery with complete functionality

See `doc/architecture/static-site-generation.md` for implementation details.


---

### EXIF Timestamp Correction **[NEXT PRIORITY]**

**Deliverable**: Timezone correction system for camera clock errors

#### Problem Identified
- Camera EXIF shows `+00:00` (UTC) timezone but timestamps are 4 hours ahead of expected UTC
- Ceremony at 4:00 PM Swedish time (UTC+2) should be 2:00 PM UTC, but photos show 6:10 PM
- All 645 photos have systematic 4-hour offset from expected UTC timing

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Settings-based offset**: Add `TIMESTAMP_OFFSET_HOURS` setting (e.g., `-4` hours)
- [ ] **Processing integration**: Apply offset during `process-photos` command
- [ ] **EXIF correction**: Modify EXIF data in production bucket copies
  - Correct `DateTimeOriginal` to proper UTC time
  - Set `OffsetTimeOriginal` to actual Swedish timezone (`+02:00`)
  - Preserve original archive files (read-only)
- [ ] **Upload detection**: Deploy command detects EXIF changes and re-uploads
- [ ] **CDN invalidation**: Trigger cache refresh when photos change
- [ ] **Documentation**: Log corrections applied for transparency

#### Implementation Plan
1. Add timezone offset setting to process-photos workflow
2. Integrate EXIF correction into production bucket upload
3. Test upload change detection and CDN invalidation
4. Validate corrected timestamps work in external photo management software

## Filename Format Analysis

### UUID vs Human-Readable Comparison

**UUIDv7 Approach (Discarded):**

- 26 characters (Base32 encoded)
- Abstract, not human-readable
- Over-engineered for wedding photo scale
- Complex implementation (~100+ lines)
- Designed for distributed systems with billions of IDs

**Human-Readable Timestamps (Selected):**

- ~35 characters but human-readable
- Instant chronological understanding
- GPS-based timezone context
- Simple implementation (~30 lines)
- Perfect for wedding-scale collections

**Decision Rationale:**
Human-readable filenames chosen because they provide immediate temporal context, sort chronologically in any file browser, and are much simpler to implement and debug. The slight length increase is offset by the massive usability improvement.

### Developer Tools (Deprioritized)

#### list-samples Command

**Status**: Deprioritized - find-samples already provides needed functionality

Originally planned to display saved sample metadata from JSON cache. However, find-samples 
already shows all necessary information when run, and the JSON output is primarily useful
for debugging. The command structure and edge case detection from find-samples proved more
valuable as building blocks for chronological UUID generation than as a standalone tool.
