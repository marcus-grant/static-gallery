- ‚úÖ **Full metadata recording**: All processing settings captured
- ‚úÖ **Settings isolation**: Tests run cleanly with `GALLERIA_TEST_MODE=1`
- ‚úÖ **326/329 tests passing**: Only 3 expected failures for unimplemented nice-to-have features

### Production Deployment Commands
```bash
# Process 645 wedding photos with timezone corrections
uv run python manage.py process-photos

# Generate static gallery site  
uv run python manage.py build

# Deploy to production S3 bucket with CORS setup
uv run python manage.py deploy --setup-cors
```

### Key System Components (All Working)
- **EXIF processing**: Timezone correction with `TARGET_TIMEZONE_OFFSET_HOURS = 2` for Swedish wedding
- **Metadata system**: Complete gallery metadata with all processing settings recorded
- **Deployment pipeline**: Hash-based selective uploads with CORS validation
- **Test isolation**: `GALLERIA_TEST_MODE=1` prevents local settings pollution

**üîß FOR NEW DEVELOPERS - CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATE**:

**What's implemented:**
- ‚úÖ `TARGET_TIMEZONE_OFFSET_HOURS` setting with full test coverage (`test/test_settings.py`)
- ‚úÖ `PhotoMetadata` dataclass has `deployment_file_hash` field (`src/models/photo.py`)
- ‚úÖ `GalleryMetadata.from_dict()` handles both hash fields correctly
- ‚úÖ `modify_exif_in_memory()` function implemented (`src/services/s3_storage.py`)
- ‚úÖ Deployment hash calculation implemented (`src/services/file_processing.py:258-285`)
- ‚úÖ Deployment orchestration functions implemented (`src/services/deployment.py`)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test suite for EXIF modification (`test/services/test_s3_storage.py`)
- ‚úÖ Integration tests for dual-hash system (`test/test_dual_hash_integration.py`)
- ‚úÖ Complete test suite for deployment orchestration (`test/services/test_deployment.py`)
- ‚úÖ Complete documentation for metadata consistency system
- ‚úÖ CORS management functions implemented (`src/services/s3_storage.py`)
- ‚úÖ Deploy command CORS integration with early exit (`src/command/deploy.py`)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive CORS test suite (`test/services/test_s3_storage.py::TestCORSConfiguration`)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced deploy command tests with CORS validation (`test/command/test_deploy.py::TestDeployCommandCORSValidation`)

**Key files to understand:**
- `src/models/photo.py` - PhotoMetadata structure with dual hashes
- `src/services/s3_storage.py` - modify_exif_in_memory() function and CORS management
- `src/services/file_processing.py` - Lines 258-285: deployment hash calculation
- `src/services/deployment.py` - Deployment orchestration with metadata-last upload ordering
- `settings.py` - Line 58: TARGET_TIMEZONE_OFFSET_HOURS setting
- `doc/architecture/metadata-consistency.md` - Complete system documentation

**Phase 3 Complete - Dual Timezone System Implemented:**

**Dual Timezone System Explanation:**
- **`TIMESTAMP_OFFSET_HOURS`**: Corrects systematic camera time errors ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
  - Example: Camera was set 2 hours fast ‚Üí offset = -2 to correct
- **`TARGET_TIMEZONE_OFFSET_HOURS`**: Sets actual timezone context for deployment ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
  - Writes timezone info to EXIF `OffsetTimeOriginal` field per EXIF 2.31 standard
  - Format: `¬±HH:MM` (e.g., `-05:00` for EST, `+02:00` for CET)
  - Special value 13 = preserve original timezone (don't modify `OffsetTimeOriginal`)
- **Combined Logic**: corrected timestamp + timezone context = complete local time information ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

‚úÖ **Completed Phase 3 Tasks:**
1. ‚úÖ **`modify_exif_in_memory()` implemented in `src/services/s3_storage.py`**:
   - Function signature: `modify_exif_in_memory(image_bytes, corrected_timestamp, target_timezone_offset_hours) -> bytes`
   - Uses `piexif` library for in-memory EXIF modification
   - Applies corrected timestamp to `DateTimeOriginal`
   - Applies timezone offset to `OffsetTimeOriginal` in `¬±HH:MM` format (unless offset = 13)
   - Complies with EXIF 2.31 standard for timezone information
2. ‚úÖ **Deployment hash calculation implemented in `src/services/file_processing.py:258-285`**:
   - Simulates EXIF modification during processing using both timezone settings
   - Calculates hash of modified image bytes (reflects both timestamp correction and timezone)
   - Stores as `deployment_file_hash` with error fallback
3. ‚úÖ **Comprehensive test suite implemented**:
   - `test/services/test_s3_storage.py::TestExifModification` (8 tests)
   - `test/test_dual_hash_integration.py` (5 integration tests)
   - Full documentation in `doc/architecture/metadata-consistency.md`

## Current JSON Metadata System **[FOR NEW DEVELOPERS]**

**How it works**:
1. **Photo Processing** (`process_dual_photo_collection`):
   - Reads EXIF from original files
   - Applies `TIMESTAMP_OFFSET_HOURS` setting in memory
   - Calculates SHA256 hash of original source files
   - Generates chronological filenames using corrected timestamps
   - Creates `gallery-metadata.json` with type-safe dataclasses

2. **Metadata Structure** (see `src/models/photo.py`):
   - `GalleryMetadata` ‚Üí `PhotoMetadata` ‚Üí `MetadataExifData` + `MetadataFileData`
   - Stores both original and corrected timestamps
   - Includes file hashes for change detection
   - Camera info and file paths for all variants (full/web/thumb)

3. **PhotoMetadataService** (`src/services/photo_metadata.py`):
   - `generate_json_metadata()` - Legacy filename parsing (backward compatibility)
   - `generate_json_metadata_from_file()` - New JSON metadata reading
   - Converts metadata to frontend-optimized format

4. **Testing** (`test/services/test_photo_metadata.py`):
   - Integration test proves complete round-trip works
   - File hash calculation verified
   - JSON metadata generation tested

## Optional Performance Enhancements **[Nice-to-Have Features]**

**Status**: Core functionality complete, these are optional improvements.

### Remaining Integration Test Failures (Expected)
- **Progress reporting**: `test_process_photos_with_progress_reporting` - No progress output during processing
- **Batch processing**: `test_batch_processing_creates_partial_files` - No partial file creation for crash recovery  
- **CLI recovery flags**: `test_process_photos_crash_recovery_with_resume_flag` - No --resume/--restart flags

### If You Want to Implement These (Optional)
1. **Progress Reporting**: Add progress output to `process_dual_photo_collection()` in `src/services/file_processing.py`
2. **Batch Processing**: Rewrite function to process photos in batches, saving partial files
3. **CLI Flags**: Add `--resume`, `--restart`, `--batch-size` flags to `src/command/process_photos.py`

**Current Performance**: 12.7s for 50 photos is acceptable. These are nice-to-have improvements for very large collections.


## Real-world Deployment Testing **[NEXT PRIORITY AFTER FIXES]**

**Objective**: Set up and test production S3/Hetzner bucket with CDN integration.

**Prerequisites**: ‚úÖ All deployment infrastructure complete (Phases 1-5 + CORS). ‚ö†Ô∏è Timezone metadata issue must be resolved first.

### Current Walkthrough Progress

**Status**: In progress - blocking issues identified during setup

**Completed Steps**:
1. ‚úÖ **Personal configuration analysis** - EXIF timezone issue identified and settings determined
2. ‚úÖ **Settings configuration** - `settings.local.py` configured with correct timezone settings
3. ‚úÖ **Process-photos execution** - Completed in 1m23s (645 photos processed)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical issues discovered** - Timezone metadata and performance issues must be resolved

**Pending Steps**:
1. **Fix timezone metadata issue** - Add `target_timezone_offset_hours` to metadata
2. **Verify test suites pass** - Ensure performance fix doesn't break functionality  
3. **Re-run process-photos** - Generate metadata with complete settings
4. **Execute build command** - Generate static site
5. **Execute deploy --setup-cors** - First production deployment
6. **Verify EXIF corrections** - Confirm timezone fixes in deployed photos

### Production Deployment Instructions

**READY TO DEPLOY**: The system is production-ready. Follow these steps for first deployment:

#### Step 1: Configure Production Settings

Add to `settings.local.py`:
```python
# S3 Production Configuration  
S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT = "https://eu-central-1.s3.hetznerobjects.com"  # Your actual endpoint
S3_PUBLIC_BUCKET = "your-actual-bucket-name"  # From bucket setup
S3_PUBLIC_REGION = "eu-central-1"  # Your bucket region

# Photo Processing Settings
TIMESTAMP_OFFSET_HOURS = -4  # Your camera systematic correction
TARGET_TIMEZONE_OFFSET_HOURS = -5  # Target timezone (e.g., EST = -5, CET = +1)
```

#### Step 2: Set Environment Variables for Secrets
```bash
export GALLERIA_S3_PUBLIC_ACCESS_KEY="your_access_key"
export GALLERIA_S3_PUBLIC_SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key"
```

#### Step 3: Complete Deployment Workflow
```bash
# Process photos with timezone corrections
uv run python manage.py process-photos

# Build static site
uv run python manage.py build

# Deploy with automatic CORS setup
uv run python manage.py deploy --setup-cors
```

**What happens**: System processes photos with `-4h` correction, applies target timezone to EXIF, generates dual hashes, validates/configures CORS, and uploads only changed photos using metadata comparison.

**Next steps after deployment**: CDN setup using `doc/bunnycdn-setup.md`

## Project Overview

A static photo gallery built with a custom Python static site generator,
using AlpineJS for frontend interactions and
Tailwind CSS for styling.
Photos are processed with human-readable chronological filenames derived from EXIF data and
hosted on Hetzner object storage with BunnyCDN for global distribution.

### Conventions of Project

This is going for a django style settings, command and layout structure.
But we're also trying to find
a middle ground between django and FastAPI conventions.
In particular with functional paradigms,
like @click decorated commands for example.
Because this line between conventions is blurry, please ask.

### Priority

Speed of development and deployment over feature richness.
Get a working, acceptable user experience deployed quickly.

## Stack & Workflow Overview

### Technology Stack

- **Static Site Generator**: Custom Python generator with Jinja2 (Python 3.12)
- **Frontend**: AlpineJS + Tailwind CSS (CDN, no build step)
- **Photo Processing**: Python with Pillow, exifread
- **Storage**: Hetzner object storage (private + public buckets)
- **CDN**: BunnyCDN with Hetzner as origin
- **Development**: Local build -> Hetzner deployment
- **Package Management**: uv (Python package manager)
- **Testing**: pytest with `uv run pytest` command

### Photo Processing Workflow

```txt
Photographer's Photos -> EXIF Extraction -> Chronological Filename Generation ->
-> Thumbnail Creation -> Upload to Buckets ->
-> Custom HTML Generation -> Deploy
```

### Photo Organization Structure

```txt
Private Bucket (Hetzner):     Public Bucket (Hetzner):        Static Site:
/originals/                   /galleria-wedding/              Gallery page with:
  IMG_001.jpg                   {filename}.jpg  (full)         - Thumbnail grid
  IMG_002.jpg                   {filename}.jpg  (web)          - Infinite scroll
  ...                           {filename}.webp (thumb)        - Multi-select downloads
```

### Storage Strategy

- **Private Hetzner Bucket**: Original photos with authentication (personal archive)
- **Public Hetzner Bucket**: Full + web + thumbnail versions (for static site)
- **BunnyCDN**: Global CDN caching content from public Hetzner bucket

### Command Workflow & Sequence

The project follows a simplified workflow for processing and deploying the photo gallery:

```txt
Original Photos (PIC_SOURCE_PATH_FULL + PIC_SOURCE_PATH_WEB)
    ‚Üì [process-photos] 
Processed Photos (prod/pics)
    ‚Üì [build]
Static Site (OUTPUT_DIR)
    ‚Üì [deploy] 
Single S3 Bucket (photos + HTML + CSS + JS)
    ‚Üì
Live Website
```

#### Command Overview

1. **`process-photos`** - Photo processing pipeline
   - Reads original photos from `PIC_SOURCE_PATH_FULL`
   - Reads web-optimized photos from `PIC_SOURCE_PATH_WEB` 
   - Extracts EXIF data and generates chronological filenames
   - Creates thumbnails (400x400 WebP) from web versions
   - Validates filename consistency between full and web collections
   - Outputs to `prod/pics` with structure:
     ```
     processed-photos/
       full/     (symlinks to originals with chronological names)
       web/      (symlinks to photographer's web-optimized versions)
       thumb/    (WebP thumbnails generated from web versions)
     ```

2. **`build`** - Static site generation  
   - Generates JSON metadata from processed photos
   - Creates static HTML using Jinja2 templates
   - Copies static assets (CSS/JS)
   - Outputs complete site to `OUTPUT_DIR`

3. **`deploy`** - Complete site deployment
   - Idempotently uploads entire site to single S3 bucket:
     - Photos (full/web/thumb) to `/photos/` prefix
     - Static site files (HTML/CSS/JS) to bucket root
     - JSON metadata for gallery functionality
   - Skips already uploaded files for efficiency
   - Supports dry-run and progress tracking
   - Handles CDN cache invalidation if needed

#### Usage Patterns

```bash
# Full pipeline for new gallery
python manage.py process-photos
python manage.py build  
python manage.py deploy --progress

# Development workflow
python manage.py process-photos --source ./test-photos
python manage.py build --dev-mode
python manage.py deploy --dry-run

# Quick site update (photos already processed)
python manage.py build
python manage.py deploy
```

**Note**: Commands are designed to be idempotent - running them multiple times is safe. The `deploy` command handles all upload operations to maintain consistency.

## Development Tasks & Specifications

### Static Site Generation **[COMPLETED]**

**Deliverable**: Static HTML gallery with complete functionality

See `doc/architecture/static-site-generation.md` for implementation details.


---

### EXIF Timestamp Correction **[NEXT PRIORITY]**

**Deliverable**: Timezone correction system for camera clock errors

#### Problem Identified
- Camera EXIF shows `+00:00` (UTC) timezone but timestamps are 4 hours ahead of expected UTC
- Ceremony at 4:00 PM Swedish time (UTC+2) should be 2:00 PM UTC, but photos show 6:10 PM
- All 645 photos have systematic 4-hour offset from expected UTC timing

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Settings-based offset**: Add `TIMESTAMP_OFFSET_HOURS` setting (e.g., `-4` hours)
- [ ] **Processing integration**: Apply offset during `process-photos` command
- [ ] **EXIF correction**: Modify EXIF data in production bucket copies
  - Correct `DateTimeOriginal` to proper UTC time
  - Set `OffsetTimeOriginal` to actual Swedish timezone (`+02:00`)
  - Preserve original archive files (read-only)
- [ ] **Upload detection**: Deploy command detects EXIF changes and re-uploads
- [ ] **CDN invalidation**: Trigger cache refresh when photos change
- [ ] **Documentation**: Log corrections applied for transparency

#### Implementation Plan
1. Add timezone offset setting to process-photos workflow
2. Integrate EXIF correction into production bucket upload
3. Test upload change detection and CDN invalidation
4. Validate corrected timestamps work in external photo management software

### Performance Optimization

- **Lazy loading**: Progressive image loading optimization
- **CDN optimization**: Advanced BunnyCDN configuration for better global performance
- **Compression**: Additional image optimization techniques

## Filename Format Analysis

### UUID vs Human-Readable Comparison

**UUIDv7 Approach (Discarded):**

- 26 characters (Base32 encoded)
- Abstract, not human-readable
- Over-engineered for wedding photo scale
- Complex implementation (~100+ lines)
- Designed for distributed systems with billions of IDs

**Human-Readable Timestamps (Selected):**

- ~35 characters but human-readable
- Instant chronological understanding
- GPS-based timezone context
- Simple implementation (~30 lines)
- Perfect for wedding-scale collections

**Decision Rationale:**
Human-readable filenames chosen because they provide immediate temporal context, sort chronologically in any file browser, and are much simpler to implement and debug. The slight length increase is offset by the massive usability improvement.

### Developer Tools (Deprioritized)

#### list-samples Command

**Status**: Deprioritized - find-samples already provides needed functionality

Originally planned to display saved sample metadata from JSON cache. However, find-samples 
already shows all necessary information when run, and the JSON output is primarily useful
for debugging. The command structure and edge case detection from find-samples proved more
valuable as building blocks for chronological UUID generation than as a standalone tool.
