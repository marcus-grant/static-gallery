# Galleria - Development Specification

**Commands implemented**: find-samples, upload-photos, process-photos

## Project Overview

A static photo gallery built with a custom Python static site generator,
using AlpineJS for frontend interactions and
Tailwind CSS for styling.
Photos are processed with human-readable chronological filenames derived from EXIF data and
hosted on Hetzner object storage with BunnyCDN for global distribution.

### Conventions of Project

This is going for a django style settings, command and layout structure.
But we're also trying to find
a middle ground between django and FastAPI conventions.
In particular with functional paradigms,
like @click decorated commands for example.
Because this line between conventions is blurry, please ask.

### Priority

Speed of development and deployment over feature richness.
Get a working, acceptable user experience deployed quickly.

## Stack & Workflow Overview

### Technology Stack

- **Static Site Generator**: Custom Python generator with Jinja2 (Python 3.12)
- **Frontend**: AlpineJS + Tailwind CSS (CDN, no build step)
- **Photo Processing**: Python with Pillow, exifread
- **Storage**: Hetzner object storage (private + public buckets)
- **CDN**: BunnyCDN with Hetzner as origin
- **Development**: Local build -> Hetzner deployment
- **Package Management**: uv (Python package manager)
- **Testing**: pytest with `uv run pytest` command

### Photo Processing Workflow

```txt
Photographer's Photos -> EXIF Extraction -> Chronological Filename Generation ->
-> Thumbnail Creation -> Upload to Buckets ->
-> Custom HTML Generation -> Deploy
```

### Photo Organization Structure

```txt
Private Bucket (Hetzner):     Public Bucket (Hetzner):        Static Site:
/originals/                   /galleria-wedding/              Gallery page with:
  IMG_001.jpg                   {filename}.jpg  (full)         - Thumbnail grid
  IMG_002.jpg                   {filename}.jpg  (web)          - Infinite scroll
  ...                           {filename}.webp (thumb)        - Multi-select downloads
```

### Storage Strategy

- **Private Hetzner Bucket**: Original photos with authentication (personal archive)
- **Public Hetzner Bucket**: Full + web + thumbnail versions (for static site)
- **BunnyCDN**: Global CDN caching content from public Hetzner bucket

### Command Workflow & Sequence

The project follows a simplified workflow for processing and deploying the photo gallery:

```txt
Original Photos (PIC_SOURCE_PATH_FULL + PIC_SOURCE_PATH_WEB)
    ↓ [process-photos] 
Processed Photos (PROCESSED_DIR)
    ↓ [build]
Static Site (OUTPUT_DIR)
    ↓ [deploy] 
Single S3 Bucket (photos + HTML + CSS + JS)
    ↓
Live Website
```

#### Command Overview

1. **`process-photos`** - Photo processing pipeline
   - Reads original photos from `PIC_SOURCE_PATH_FULL`
   - Reads web-optimized photos from `PIC_SOURCE_PATH_WEB` 
   - Extracts EXIF data and generates chronological filenames
   - Creates thumbnails (400x400 WebP) from web versions
   - Validates filename consistency between full and web collections
   - Outputs to `PROCESSED_DIR` with structure:
     ```
     processed-photos/
       full/     (symlinks to originals with chronological names)
       web/      (symlinks to photographer's web-optimized versions)
       thumb/    (WebP thumbnails generated from web versions)
     ```

2. **`build`** - Static site generation  
   - Generates JSON metadata from processed photos
   - Creates static HTML using Jinja2 templates
   - Copies static assets (CSS/JS)
   - Outputs complete site to `OUTPUT_DIR`

3. **`deploy`** - Complete site deployment
   - Idempotently uploads entire site to single S3 bucket:
     - Photos (full/web/thumb) to `/photos/` prefix
     - Static site files (HTML/CSS/JS) to bucket root
     - JSON metadata for gallery functionality
   - Skips already uploaded files for efficiency
   - Supports dry-run and progress tracking
   - Handles CDN cache invalidation if needed

#### Usage Patterns

```bash
# Full pipeline for new gallery
python manage.py process-photos
python manage.py build  
python manage.py deploy --progress

# Development workflow
python manage.py process-photos --source ./test-photos
python manage.py build --dev-mode
python manage.py deploy --dry-run

# Quick site update (photos already processed)
python manage.py build
python manage.py deploy
```

**Note**: Commands are designed to be idempotent - running them multiple times is safe. The `deploy` command handles all upload operations to maintain consistency.

## Post-Deployment Enhancements

### Frontend Functionality **[MOVED FROM PRE-DEPLOY - FIRST PRIORITY]**

**Deliverable**: Interactive photo gallery with AlpineJS

#### Pre-requisite: Fix Hot Reload Bug

**IMPORTANT**: The serve command's hot reloading server often fails to hot reload on template changes. This will become frustrating during complex frontend development. Fix this bug before implementing any other frontend changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Photo grid displays thumbnails correctly
- [ ] Infinite scroll loads photos progressively
- [ ] Checkbox selection updates state
- [ ] Download functionality triggers individual file downloads
- [ ] Select all/none buttons work correctly
- [ ] Mobile-responsive interaction

#### AlpineJS Component Structure

```javascript
Alpine.data('photoGallery', () => ({
    photos: [],
    selectedPhotos: [],
    loadedCount: 0,
    batchSize: 20,
    
    // Methods
    loadMorePhotos(),
    togglePhoto(photoId),
    selectAll(),
    selectNone(),
    downloadSelected(resolution)
}))
```

#### Frontend Features Required

- Lazy loading of thumbnails
- Visual feedback for selected photos
- Download progress indication
- Error handling for failed downloads
- Keyboard navigation support

### Dynamic Loading & Performance

**Deliverable**: Progressive loading optimization for large photo collections

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Infinite Scroll Loading**: Split photo rendering between initial batch (server-side) and progressive loading (JS)
- [ ] **Lazy Loading**: Progressive image loading optimization
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Real-world performance metrics collection
- [ ] **BunnyCDN Analytics Integration**: Parse CDN access logs for photo popularity tracking
- [ ] **Popularity-Based Ordering**: Sort photos by download frequency from CDN logs

### EXIF Timestamp Correction **[POST-DEPLOY PRIORITY]**

**Deliverable**: Timezone correction system for camera clock errors

#### Problem Identified
- Camera EXIF shows `+00:00` (UTC) timezone but timestamps are 4 hours ahead of expected UTC
- Ceremony at 4:00 PM Swedish time (UTC+2) should be 2:00 PM UTC, but photos show 6:10 PM
- All 645 photos have systematic 4-hour offset from expected UTC timing

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Settings-based offset**: Add `TIMESTAMP_OFFSET_HOURS` setting (e.g., `-4` hours)
- [ ] **Processing integration**: Apply offset during `process-photos` command
- [ ] **EXIF correction**: Modify EXIF data in production bucket copies
  - Correct `DateTimeOriginal` to proper UTC time
  - Set `OffsetTimeOriginal` to actual Swedish timezone (`+02:00`)
  - Preserve original archive files (read-only)
- [ ] **Upload detection**: Deploy command detects EXIF changes and re-uploads
- [ ] **CDN invalidation**: Trigger cache refresh when photos change
- [ ] **Documentation**: Log corrections applied for transparency

#### Implementation Plan
1. Add timezone offset setting to process-photos workflow
2. Integrate EXIF correction into production bucket upload
3. Test upload change detection and CDN invalidation
4. Validate corrected timestamps work in external photo management software

### Photo Modal Navigation **[MOVED FROM PRE-DEPLOY]**

**Deliverable**: Interactive photo preview with navigation

#### Photo Modal Navigation Design

- **Modal Size**: 80% viewport (keeping 20% for dismiss area)
- **Navigation Zones**: 
  - Left 25% of modal: Previous photo
  - Right 25% of modal: Next photo  
  - Middle 50%: No action (view photo)
- **Navigation Features**:
  - Wrap-around navigation (first ↔ last)
  - ESC key to close modal
  - Click backdrop (20% area) to close
- **Implementation**: Alpine.js with click zones and keyboard handlers

### Interactive Photo Selection

**Deliverable**: Multi-select download functionality

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Checkbox Selection**: Add checkboxes to photo cells for multi-select
- [ ] **Selection Controls**: Select all/none buttons, selection counter
- [ ] **Download Functionality**: Batch download of selected photos (web/full resolution)
- [ ] **Selection State Management**: Persistent selection across page interactions
- [ ] **Selection Bar**: Bottom overlay showing selected count and actions

- **CDN optimization**: Advanced BunnyCDN configuration for better global performance
- **Compression**: Additional image optimization techniques

## Filename Format Analysis

### UUID vs Human-Readable Comparison

**UUIDv7 Approach (Discarded):**

- 26 characters (Base32 encoded)
- Abstract, not human-readable
- Over-engineered for wedding photo scale
- Complex implementation (~100+ lines)
- Designed for distributed systems with billions of IDs

**Human-Readable Timestamps (Selected):**

- ~35 characters but human-readable
- Instant chronological understanding
- GPS-based timezone context
- Simple implementation (~30 lines)
- Perfect for wedding-scale collections

**Decision Rationale:**
Human-readable filenames chosen because they provide immediate temporal context, sort chronologically in any file browser, and are much simpler to implement and debug. The slight length increase is offset by the massive usability improvement.

### Developer Tools (Deprioritized)

#### list-samples Command

**Status**: Deprioritized - find-samples already provides needed functionality

Originally planned to display saved sample metadata from JSON cache. However, find-samples 
already shows all necessary information when run, and the JSON output is primarily useful
for debugging. The command structure and edge case detection from find-samples proved more
valuable as building blocks for chronological UUID generation than as a standalone tool.

*This specification prioritizes rapid deployment of core functionality. Features marked as "Future" can be implemented in subsequent iterations after the initial gallery is live and functional.*
