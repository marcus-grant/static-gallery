# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains system architecture documentation for Galleria's core components and design patterns.

## Components

- **[Static Site Generation](static-site-generation.md)** - Template system, build process, and development server architecture
- **[Metadata Consistency System](metadata-consistency.md)** - Dual-hash metadata system for idempotent deployments and local/remote state consistency

## Overview

Architecture documentation covers the high-level design decisions, component interactions, and implementation patterns used throughout Galleria. Each document focuses on a specific architectural area with implementation details and design rationale.

## Contributing

When adding new architecture documentation:
1. Focus on design decisions and component relationships
2. Include implementation details that affect system behavior
3. Document trade-offs and rationale for architectural choices
4. Update this README with new documents
