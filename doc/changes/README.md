# Change Logs

## Overview

This is where we store older change log documents.
Each sub-directory from here represents a year of an archived set of
changelog notes stored in a document representing a month.
The [most current changelog](../CHANGELOG.md) is where all changelogs start.
Then their date stamped sections get moved to their associated
`doc/old-changelogs/YEAR/LEADING_ZERO_MONTH_NUM-MONTH_NAME.md` doc.
